Install Java 8:
========================================================================
1. Add Java 8 PPA

$ sudo gvim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/java-8-debian.list

and add following content in it.

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main

Now import GPG key on your system for validating packages before installing them.

$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EEA14886

2. Install Java 8 on Debian

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

3. Verify Java Version

$ java -version






google: install elasticsearch debian
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html


=================================================================
=================================================================
google: install kibana debian
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/deb.html

Download and install the public signing key:
cd ~/Downloads
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Save the repository definition to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list:
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kibana
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch


========================================================

To configure Kibana to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following commands:

sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable kibana.service

Kibana can be started and stopped as follows:

sudo systemctl start kibana.service
sudo systemctl stop kibana.service

These commands provide no feedback as to whether Kibana was started successfully or not. Instead, this information will be written in the log files located in /var/log/kibana/.


=======================================================
Running Elasticsearch with systemd

To configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following commands:

sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service

Elasticsearch can be started and stopped as follows:

sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service

These commands provide no feedback as to whether Elasticsearch was started successfully or not. Instead, this information will be written in the log files located in /var/log/elasticsearch/.

By default the Elasticsearch service doesnâ€™t log information in the systemd journal. To enable journalctl logging, the --quiet option must be removed from the ExecStart command line in the elasticsearch.service file.

When systemd logging is enabled, the logging information are available using the journalctl commands:

To tail the journal:

sudo journalctl -f

To list journal entries for the elasticsearch service:

sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch

To list journal entries for the elasticsearch service starting from a given time:

sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch --since  "2016-10-30 18:17:16"

Check man journalctl or https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journalctl.html for more command line options.
